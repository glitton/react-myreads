# MyReads App - A book search application


This myReads is a React app that categorizes books in shelves labeled Currently Reading, Want To Read, and Read.  Users can search a catalog, add and categorize these books into their collection.   

# Start The Application
Clone/Download this repository
cd into the project root and run npm install
run npm start
go to localhost:3000

## Note on the Search Functionality
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
